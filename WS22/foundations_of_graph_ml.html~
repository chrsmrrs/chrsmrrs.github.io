        <p>
	  Graph-structured data is ubiquitous across application domains ranging from chemo- and bioinformatics to image and social network analysis. To develop successful machine learning algorithms, we need techniques that map the rich information inherent in the graph structure to a vectorial representation in a meaningful wayâ€”so-called graph embeddings. Designing such embeddings comes with unique challenges. The embedding has to account for the complex structure of (real-world) networks and additional high-dimensional continuous vectors attached to nodes and edges in a (permutation) invariant way while being scalable to massive graphs or sets of graphs. Moreover, when used in supervised machine learning, the model trained with such embeddings must generalize well to new or previously unseen (graph) instances. Hence, more abstractly, designing graph embeddings results in a trade-off between (1) expressivity, (2) scalability, and (3) generalization. In this seminar, we want to discuss the current progress on the theoretical foundations of machine learning on graphs, penetrating the above-listed three challenges.</p>

	<h3>Requirements for Passing</h3>
        <div style="background-color:#e0e5e0;padding:15px;padding-bottom:1px">
	For passing the seminar, you need to fullfill the following:
	<ol>
	  <li>Give a 30-minute long talk about about your assigned paper.</li>
	  <li>Write a 12 to 15 page detailled report about assigned paper.</li>
	  <li>Peer-review your fellow students reports.</li>
	  <li>Attend all meetings and actively participate, see below for dates.</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

	<h3>Talks</h3>
	At the end of the semester, each student will give a 30-minute, more detailed talk about their assigned paper. You should provide an overview of your assigned paper and highlight the most important concepts and ideas. Ideally, your presentation should give the audience (i.e., your fellow students) a good understanding of your assigned paper.

	<h3>Report</h3>
	The report gives a detailed overview of the assigned paper. The required report length is 12 to 15 pages, using the the provided LaTeX template. This means that after you find your topic, you write your paper and submit it for "peer review" by your fellow students. You will receive constructive feedback to improve the paper, afterwards you will receive additional feedback from the seminar organizers. You can then submit an updated, final version, which will be graded. Note that this means that you will also have to write some short evaluations on the reports of other seminar participants.

	<h3>Organization</h3>
	<ol>
	  <li>More details are given during the mandatory kick-off meeting.</li>
	  <li>Papers will be assigned after the above meeting.</li>
	  <li>The long talks will be presented in day-long block seminar.</li>
	  <li>All meeting will take place in Room .</li>
	</ol>
