        <p>I am looking for highly motivated PhD students for my newly established group at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RWTH_Aachen_University">RWTH Aachen</a> in Germany, one of Germany's leading universities of technology. I am especially interested in strong students with a background in <b>theoretical computer science, (discrete) mathematics, and (theoretical) machine learning</b>, willing to push the boundaries of the theoretical underpinnings of machine learning with graphs. Moreover, I am also interested in students with a background in combinatorial optimization interested in working at the intersection of machine learning and the former.</p>

Students are paid according to the collective labor agreement TVöD <a href="https://oeffentlicher-dienst.info/c/t/rechner/tv-l/allg?id=tv-l&g=E_13&s=1&zv=VBL&z=100&zulage=&stkl=1&r=&zkf=&kk=15.5%25">level E13</a>, amounting to an approximate monthly net salary of 2200€ in the first year, including health insurance and social security.</p>
